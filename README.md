# Scheduler
=========

An employee scheduling script. 

Warning: I am a beginner programmer. Take this app with a grain of salt.

After 7 years of retail and countless excuses from management about the
difficulty of creating a schedule, I decided to try to ease the process.

Scheduler is designed to give a comprehensive starting point for a schedule. It
randomly assigns shifts to employees based on their available days and hours
and exports the data to an excel file for further manipulation. 

Currently, Scheduler is simply a python script and can be run from the command
line. I hope to make either a GUI excecutable or web app for use in the future.

## How to use
=============
Don't. Honestly. It's nowhere near ready. If you want, you're welcome to peruse the code though. It's not complex
## Some Notes
=============

Scheduler is meant to create a starting point for your schedule, not
necessarily a final product. Following this philosophy, scheduler will create
an entry for "unassigned" and allocate any shifts it cannot assign there. After
the schedule is created, you are encouraged to adjust it to your needs.
