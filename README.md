Scheduler
=========

An employee scheduling script. 

After 7 years of retail and countless excuses from management about the
difficulty of creating a schedule, I decided to try to ease the process.

Scheduler is designed to give a comprehensive starting point for a schedule. It
randomly assigns shifts to employees based on their available days and hours
and exports the data to an excel file for further manipulation. 

Currently, Scheduler is simply a python script and can be run from the command
line. I hope to make either a GUI excecutable or web app for use in the future.

## How to use
=============

Since Scheduler is a python script, you can run it from the command line.
