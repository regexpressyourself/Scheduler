First working version:

TM class tracks how many hours a TM can work alongside 
how many hour they have worked already.

Day class handles a dictionary of {start:end} shift info.
It supports the ability to add shifts for each day and store
them in the dictionary.

User inputs shifts for each day and max hours for each TM. The
program automatically assigns random shifts to random employees
and outputs the data into a excell file. 

If shifts are left blank due to lack of employees, shift will
be displayed "BLANK"
